# VPN Connection Guide

This is a guide that explains how to connect your home television to your home network using a VPN server. It provides step-by-step instructions for configuring the necessary apps and devices.

## How to Run Locally

To run the site locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Open a command-line interface (CLI) such as Terminal or Command Prompt.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located.

4. Install the project dependencies by running the following command: `npm install`

5. Once the dependencies are installed, start the local development server with the following command: `npm start`

6. The site will be served locally at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the VPN Connection Guide.

## Dependencies

This project uses Lite Server for serving the site locally. The necessary dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.
